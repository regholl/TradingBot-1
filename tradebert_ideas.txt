Tradebert ideas 

Neural network trading bot that will trade stocks and crypto currency, and will improve with time based on combination of previous trades data and pulled from the internet. 

Neural network should be able to speculate about the future price of an asset by a certain date and make purchasing decisions based on that prediction. If the prediction is proved to be incorrect or correct the algorithm should adjust its strategies appropriately 

The bot should trade stocks and crypto currencies in four distinct ways 

Stock & Crypto futures 
Stock & Crypto options 
Stock & Crypto long term  
Stock & Crypto short term/day trading

The bot should be able to transfer funds in between these accounts to help maximize profits, for instance if the bot makes a ridiculous amount in day trading on one day it should move a portion of those profits to the long term trading account.
