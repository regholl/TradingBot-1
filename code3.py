Added necessary imports for train_test_split, LinearRegression. # 2. Added try-except block to handle file not found error. # 3. Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code and any important details to understand. # 4. Generated a plot to visualize the results of the example predictive model to identify potential issues and improvements for the trading strategy.
